                <h3>The Underwater Seaweed Drone Unit.<hr></h3>
                <p>Our project, the Underwater Seaweed Drone Inspection Investigation, was born out of a pressing need to address some of the environmental challenges that our oceans face today. The inspiration came from our deepening understanding of the crucial role seaweed plays in the ecosystem. Seaweed is known for its remarkable ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, making it one of the most effective natural solutions to combat climate change. This vital plant not only helps in reducing greenhouse gases but also contributes to oxygen production, creating a healthier environment for both marine life and humans.</p>
                <p>  However, during our research, we encountered a significant threat to seaweed populations: sea urchins. These spiny marine creatures are voracious eaters of seaweed, and their growing populations can devastate underwater forests, leading to a decline in biodiversity and a reduction in the ecological services that seaweed provides. The juxtaposition of the benefits of seaweed against the challenges posed by sea urchins sparked the idea for our project. We envisioned developing an underwater drone that could not only detect sea urchins but also analyze water conditions to ensure the survival and growth of seaweed.</p>
                <p>Our project, The Underwater Seaweed Drone Inspection Investigation (Now Underwater Sea Drone Unit), integrates advanced technologies to detect sea urchins and support seaweed sustainability. At its core is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which powers the system and runs a TensorFlow-based AI model trained using Google’s Teachable Machine to identify sea urchins via a Raspberry Pi Camera Module. To handle the computational demands of real-time detection, we incorporated a Google Coral USB Accelerator (TPU) for efficient AI processing. A GPS module enables precise geotagging of sea urchin locations, which are visualized using Google Maps APIs, while a Discord webhook delivers instant notifications of detections. Future upgrades, if additional time and funding were available, include a professional underwater camera for higher detection accuracy, a water quality testing module to measure pH and chemical levels for seaweed growth, and a high-capacity lithium-ion battery for longer underwater operation. Enhanced waterproofing and durability, using marine-grade aluminum and epoxy seals, are also planned to improve the system’s resilience in marine environments. By combining current and future technologies, this project demonstrates the potential for innovative solutions to protect and support critical underwater ecosystems.

            <h3>Possible Applications?<hr></h3>
            <p>Another addition to this project's value could be its impact not just on kelp forests but also on agriculture and invasive species monitoring. This system could be brought above the water and turned into an air drone, allowing it to do agriculture. In agro it could do weed spoting and burning if a small point-and-shoot laser was attached. It could also check if all of the seedlings are planted and growing well, it could do periodic checks on crops and flag ones that need attention. You could keep the drone with wings and a solar panel, and pick up bits of trash and dump them on boats. It could stay under the water and find invasive green shore crabs or carp. This all could be done very easily by just taking the shell of the project and putting propellers on it or just tweaking the software. <p>
